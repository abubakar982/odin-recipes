# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

In this project, I built a basic recipe website using only HTML.
It demonstrates:
- Proper HTML boilerplate structure
- Use of headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links
- Correct file and folder organization
- Basic Git and GitHub workflow

This project focuses on HTML fundamentals. Styling will be added later using CSS.
